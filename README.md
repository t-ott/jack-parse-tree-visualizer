# Jack Parse Tree Visualizer

Enter Jack code, visualize the parse tree as generated by a Jack compiler.

Tree visualization built with [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3), compiler written in Python and run in the browser with [pyscript](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript).

## TODO
- [x] Orient the parse tree vertically rather than horizontally
- [ ] Style the nodes so that the tags and values are distinct from each other
- [x] Style the page so that the Jack "IDE" is on the left, and the parse tree is on the right
- [ ] Size the parse tree dynamically so that the whole tree is visible and nicely spaced when initially rendered
- [ ] Add some sort of help document/popup/link for writing proper Jack syntax
- [ ] Do some sort of general error handling for compilation errors
- [ ] Add option to collapse and expand nodes and their children as an interactive component
- [ ] Integrate a working version into [t-ott.dev](https://www.t-ott.dev/)
